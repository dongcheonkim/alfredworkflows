## Alfred 3 Workflows:

[Bear Notes Search (Download)](https://github.com/oderwat/alfredworkflows/raw/master/Bear%20Notes%20Search.alfredworkflow) - Lets you search for notes in the great [Bear](www.bear-writer.com/) application.

* Use spaces to separate words: this that
* Use quotes to search for the phrase: "this that"
* Use + to "requite" a word: this +that
* Use - to "exclude" a word: this -that
* Use * to search for "any string"

### Example 1:

`red blue -green +apple`

Searches for ("red" or "yellow") and not "green" and "apple"

### Example 2:

`project +#work*/client1 +"mysql"`

Searches for all notes containing the words "project" and "mysql" having a tag that starts with "work" and ends with the subtag "client1"

### Example 3:

`[*.j*g] [*.png] [*.gif]`

Searches for all Notes containing a jpeg, gif or png image.

### Example 4:

    ```meta*saveas:*

Searches for all Notes with a BearNanny saved Codeblock :)
